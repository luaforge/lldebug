Copy the `boost' and `libs' directories into an existing boost 1.33.0, 1.33.1,
1.34 or 1.34.1 distribution.

Before using Boost.Asio, the Boost.System library needs to be built. This can
be done by running bjam in the libs/system/build directory. Consult the Boost
Getting Started page (http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html) for more
information on how to build the Boost libraries.
